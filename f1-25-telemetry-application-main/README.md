### <ins>Step 1 : Run the application</ins><a id="step1"></a>
1. Make sure all the required python packages are installed :

``` 
2. Run *Telemetry.py*

### <ins>Step 2 : Send datas to the application </ins> <a id="step2"></a>
Open the F1 Game :
- ➡️ Go to Settings, Telemetry Settings
- ➡️ Make sure the port in-game matches the port used by the application (20777 by default)
- ➡️ **If your game is connected to the same network as your computer running this application**, the easiest way is to enable the <u>UDP Broadcast</u> setting.
**If not**, you have to enter your public IP address in the <u>IP Address</u> setting.
- ✅ You are then good to go !


## ✏️ To-do list <a id="to-do-list"></a>
* Rajouter la vitesse au speed trap
* Fix the issue with weather Forecast Sample in 100% (Too many samples ?)
* Improve the overall appearance of the app (flag apparition, title)
* Track a bug where all not cars are shown in the minimap during full qualifying session
* Track a bug in full qualifying, session.nb_players might return 8 if 2 players retired instead of 10 anyway
* Improving map appearance
* Point not aligned with map (Belgium)

Telemetry issues :
* Check glitch on the grid where track_id is correctly set but marshals_zones are set to 0
Try 2024 version
