# Bug Fixes - Race Flow System

## Issue #1: Missing PERFORMANCE_MODE Constant

**Error:**
```
NameError: name 'PERFORMANCE_MODE' is not defined
```

**Location:** `src/receiver.py` line 661

**Cause:** The `PERFORMANCE_MODE` constant was referenced but never defined in the constants section.

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Added to line 40 in src/receiver.py
PERFORMANCE_MODE = True  # Enable performance optimizations (async sends, reduced logging)
```

**Impact:** Without this fix, the receiver would crash immediately on startup.

## Issue #2: Typo in Constant Name

**Error:**
```
NameError: name 'STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL' is not defined. Did you mean: 'STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL_S'?
```

**Location:** `src/receiver.py` line 1736

**Cause:** Constant name was missing the `_S` suffix (should be `STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL_S`, not `STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL`).

**Fix Applied:**
```python
# Changed line 1736 from:
status_interval = STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL if PERFORMANCE_MODE else STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S

# To:
status_interval = STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL_S if PERFORMANCE_MODE else STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S
```

**Impact:** Without this fix, the receiver would crash in the main loop every few seconds.

## Verification

Both issues have been fixed and verified:

```bash
# Test suite passes
python3 tests/test_race_flow.py
# Result: ✅ All 6 tests passed

# Constants are properly defined
python3 -c "from receiver import PERFORMANCE_MODE, STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL_S, STATUS_UPDATE_INTERVAL_S"
# Result: No errors
```

---

## System Status: ✅ OPERATIONAL

The race flow system is now fully operational and ready for use.

**Start the system:**
```bash
python3 scripts/run_dashboard.py --driver "System"
```

**Expected startup messages:**
- ✅ Flask app starts on port 8080
- ✅ UDP receiver binds to port 20777
- ✅ Main loop starts waiting for telemetry
- ✅ No errors or crashes

## Files Modified

1. `src/receiver.py` - Added missing constant and fixed typo
   - Line 40: Added `PERFORMANCE_MODE = True`
   - Line 1736: Fixed `STATUS_LOG_INTERVAL_S` typo
