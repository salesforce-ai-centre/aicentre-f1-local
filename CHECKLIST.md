## ‚òëÔ∏è Daily Operations

### Morning Startup
- [ ] Turn on all 3 PCs
- [ ] Sims auto-load attract screens
- [ ] F1 games running in background on both sims
- [ ] Run `./scripts/start_mac.sh` on host
- [ ] Verify Flask server running
- [ ] Verify both receivers running
- [ ] Check logs for errors

### During Event
- [ ] Participants scan QR codes
- [ ] Operator presses START when ready
- [ ] Race proceeds with live telemetry
- [ ] Operator presses STOP when finished
- [ ] Results displayed
- [ ] Operator presses RESTART for next race

### End of Day
- [ ] Run `./scripts/stop_mac.sh` on host
- [ ] Close F1 games on both sims
- [ ] (Optional) Backup database (`cp data/sessions.db data/backup/`)
- [ ] Turn off all PCs

## ‚òëÔ∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Problem: No telemetry data
- [ ] Check F1 game UDP settings
- [ ] Verify IP and port configuration
- [ ] Check receiver logs (`tail -f logs/receiver-rig*.log`)
- [ ] Test UDP connection (`sudo tcpdump -i any udp port 20777`)

### Problem: Attract screen not loading
- [ ] Check Chrome is running (`ps aux | grep chrome`)
- [ ] Test URL manually (`curl http://172.18.159.209:8080/attract?rig=1`)
- [ ] Check autostart file (`cat ~/.config/autostart/f1-attract.desktop`)
- [ ] Check for JavaScript errors (F12 in browser)

### Problem: Stream Deck not working
- [ ] Test API manually (`curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/control/start-race`)
- [ ] Check Flask logs (`tail -f logs/flask.log`)
- [ ] Verify SSH works (`ssh sim1admin@192.168.8.22 "echo test"`)
- [ ] Check wmctrl installed on sims

### Problem: Sessions not completing
- [ ] Check session exists (`curl http://localhost:8080/api/session/active/1`)
- [ ] Manually complete (`./scripts/reset_session.sh`)
- [ ] Check Flask logs for errors
- [ ] Verify database file exists (`ls -lh data/sessions.db`)

## ‚úÖ System Ready!

If all checkboxes are complete, your F1 simulator system is fully operational!

**Next steps:**
1. Review [QUICKSTART.md](QUICKSTART.md) for daily operations
2. Test with real participants
3. Configure internet access for external QR codes (see [DEPLOYMENT.md](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md))
4. Enjoy! üèÅ
